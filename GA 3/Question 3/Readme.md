# Script to Pre-fill JSON Structure in Textarea

This script is used to dynamically populate a textarea with a JSON structure, which can be used for API requests. You can modify various parts of the script to customize it for different use cases. The script includes styling to ensure the textarea is visible and editable, and the JSON structure is pre-filled.

```javascript
// Step 1: Select the textarea element using its ID
// Modify the ID to match the one used in your HTML.
const textarea = document.getElementById('q-generate-addresses-with-llms');

// Step 2: Make the textarea visible and editable
// These styles ensure that the textarea becomes visible and interactable.
textarea.style.visibility = 'visible';  // Makes the textarea visible
textarea.style.opacity = '1';           // Ensures it is fully opaque (not transparent)
textarea.style.display = 'block';      // Ensures it is displayed as a block element
textarea.removeAttribute('disabled');  // Enables the textarea if it was previously disabled

// Step 3: Pre-fill the textarea with the JSON structure
// This JSON can be customized according to the properties you want to change.

const defaultJson = JSON.stringify({
  model: "gpt-4o-mini",  // Change the model to whatever is appropriate, e.g., "gpt-4" or "text-davinci-003"
  
  // Define the series of messages exchanged with the system
  messages: [
    {
      role: "system",  // Set the role to "system" to define the behavior of the model
      content: "Respond in JSON"  // Change the content to adjust the model's behavior
    },
    {
      role: "user",  // Set the role to "user" for the user's message
      content: "Generate 10 random addresses in the US"  // Modify this text to suit the user's request
    }
  ],

  // Step 4: Customize the response format
  // You can change this structure depending on what kind of response you want.
  response_format: {
    type: "json_schema",  // Change this to another type if needed (e.g., "text", "xml")
    
    // Customize the JSON schema that dictates how the response should be structured
    json_schema: {
      name: "address_response",  // Change the name of the response schema to match your use case
      strict: true,  // Set to false if you want to allow flexible responses
      schema: {
        type: "object",  // The overall response is an object (you can change this to "array" or "string" if needed)
        properties: {
          addresses: {
            type: "array",  // The 'addresses' field is an array of objects. Adjust the type to fit your needs.
            items: {
              type: "object",  // Each address is an object with properties like 'country', 'state', etc.
              properties: {
                country: { type: "string" },  // The country field is a string. You can change the field names and types.
                state: { type: "string" },    // The state field is a string. Modify this to match your property names.
                apartment: { type: "string" } // The apartment field is also a string. Customize this property as needed.
              },
              required: ["country", "state", "apartment"],  // These fields are required in each address (adjust as needed).
              additionalProperties: false  // Disallows extra fields in each address object. Set to true to allow extra fields.
            }
          }
        },
        required: ["addresses"],  // Ensure that the 'addresses' field is always present
        additionalProperties: false  // Disallows extra properties at the top level of the response object.
      }
    }
  }
}, null, 2);  // Pretty-print the JSON with 2 spaces of indentation for better readability

// Step 5: Set the default JSON structure into the textarea
// This sets the generated JSON into the textarea for the user to review or edit.
textarea.value = defaultJson;  // Fill the textarea with the pre-filled JSON
